# Real-time-driver-drowsiness-detection-system-using-AI
The Real-Time Driver Drowsiness Detection System leverages artificial intelligence to enhance road safety by continuously monitoring drivers for signs of fatigue and alertness.This project aims to develop a driver drowsiness detection system that leverages TensorFlow for machine learning model development and OpenCV for real-time image processing. By continuously monitoring the driver's facial expressions and eye movements, the system will detect signs of drowsiness and issue alerts to prevent potential accidents. The proposed solution will employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately classify the state of the driver's eyes as open or closed, using video footage captured from a camera mounted on the vehicle's dashboard.

# Dataset
The model is trained using the closed and open eye images in the dataset Drowsiness_dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dheerajperumandla/drowsiness-dataset?select=train
